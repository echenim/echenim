# 👋 Hi, I’m William!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for building high-throughput, high-volume distributed systems. If you love tech, chess, or just want to geek out over Kafka topics, you’re in the right place. 😄

## 🚀 What I Do

- Write code that moves fast and scales even faster
- Architect, develop, and optimize distributed systems
- Build and maintain RTB (Real-Time Bidding) systems
- Tinker with high-performance event streaming (Kafka, Flink)
- Always learning, always shipping

## 🛠️ Top Skills

- **Languages:** Go, Rust, Python, C#.Net
- **Tech:** Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- **Expertise:** Distributed Systems, RTB, High Throughput/High Volume Systems

## ♟️ Fun Fact

When I’m not wrangling distributed systems, you’ll probably find me deep in a game of chess. Challenge me if you dare!
